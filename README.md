## Description

This project was a course assignment at school. The goal was to create a fully functioning e-commerce store using React. The application allows users to view, search and add products to their shopping cart. The e-commerce store connects to the Noroff API to fetch product data, which is then displayed as individual product cards. The application uses React Router for navigation between pages, and employs dynamic routing for the individual product pages.

- React Context API for shopping cart functionality
- React Router DOM for routing between pages and dynamically routing to individual pages

## Built With

- React JS
